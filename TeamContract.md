### Interaction

* All members will work together to allow everyone equal opportunities to speak and participate.
* All members will attentively listen to each other’s ideas and contributions.
* Any member who may need additional help will be supported.

## Decision Making

* Decisions will be made by majority vote, after everyone has had a chance to share their perspective.

## Conflict resolution

* If no resolution is reached, the team will consult with TA or instructor together.
* Members will always keep communication respectful--dismissive comments are not acceptable.
